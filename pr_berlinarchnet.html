					<p>Berlin Architectural Network is a Ruby on Rails Application built for the homonymous <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BAN-Berlin-Architectural-Network/" title="Link to BAN Meetup group">Meetup group</a>, which I've created in 2017. Since then, it has attracted hundreds of architecture lovers who come together to support each other through collaboration and networked learning.</p>
          <p>Together with my team from the Bootcamp at Le Wagon, we've built this web application from scratch with Ruby, HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.</p>
					<p>Building a social platform as the final project in only 2 week's time, required a good understanding of data base architecture, overall enjoyable user experience as well as skills on time and product management.</p>

					<p>The purpose of this project is to support architects, who are new Berlin, on getting into the city's architecture scene and give the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BAN-Berlin-Architectural-Network/" title="Link to BAN Meetup group">Meetup group</a> an online presence. The design process had 3 major phases:</p>

					<h6>Phase 1 - Sign up</h6> 
					<p>After defining each step of the user journey and the app's core features along with a Figma prototype, we designed the database schema and built the corresponding models on Rails. At this point we introduced devise for authentication and pundit for authorization, so that the user could sign up and become a member of the community. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
					<h6>Phase 2 - Browse</h6>
					<p>On the second phase the user should be able to visit an office's page and check out a member's activity related to that office. For the database seeding, we used the JSON format due to it fast execution and versatility. We also worked with services such as Cloudinary to host and upload images and Mapbox to display the location of the offices. </p> 
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
					<h6>Phase 3 - Interact</h6>
					<p>The last phase allowed the user to RSVP to an event, review it and finally chat with a member about his experience. AJAX was used for rspving and posting comments, which allowed new content to be displayed without refreshing. For the chat, we've built a bidirectional Websocket connection in combination with Action Cable for real-time messaging.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3">Database Architecture</h3>
					<p>The database was a highlight of this project because of its complexity. There was a total of 12 models. </p>
					<p>Something unusual about this schema is the comments table that allows foreign keys to be nullified. This decision was made in order to reduce the number of tables. Even though this is valid and works, it's something i would rather break into smaller tables in the future, for the sake of simplicity.</p>
					<p>It was nonetheless an opportunity to try and see a different solution on action.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3">Teamwork on Github</h3>
					<p>Commands such as add, commit, push and pull became second nature. We also got better at writing commit messages and naming our branches properly so that others could understand it.</p>
					<p>After working on someone else's feature and causing a lot conflicts, which had to be reviewed line by line on github, I understood that pair programming would have been the right solution to my problem.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3">Agile Mindset</h3>
					<p>Throughout my professional experience, as an architect, i’ve explored the benefits of agile management on building design. My previous experience on coordinating small teams guided me throughout the process of building this app.</p>
					<p>Despite the short timeline of 2 weeks, we were able to put the project up and running for the demo day and had time to work on extra features. Only because we've implemented scrum rituals, such as standups, and kept a clean kanban board on trello, which helped us visualize our progress and workflow as a team.</p>
					<p>I've realized that having a clear understanding of each feature and its priorities, played a determinant role on the team's productivity and efficiency.</p>
